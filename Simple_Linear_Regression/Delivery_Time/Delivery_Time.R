#Here we conclude that Log Model has better R-square value as 0.7109 and Residual Standard Error as 0.1755 but we
#get Even better R-Square value by removing the Points that Influence the model which reduces the Accuracy.
#The best Model we got is model1 with R-Square value as0.8332 with Residual Standard Error as 1.839
